# Masters-Project
This repository contains the scripts I wrote for my masters' project on scalar dark energy. It is divided into two distinct parts. They are described below:

Part I:
This part concerns my research into a triggered scaling quintessence (TSQ) model of dark energy. I wrote and used these scripts to generate the  predicted fractional changes in three key cosmologyical parameters: luminosity distance, growth factor and the Hubble constant. These values were then compared to the predictions of the Î›CDM model to see if both data sets could be distinguished by the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (NGRST). Please note that these scripts generated many data files that have not been included for brevity. 

Part II: 
This part concerns my research scripts for early dark energy and whether it could resolve both the Hubble and Sigma-8 Tensions.
